# Overview

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a document that describes what and how the software/system will do. It includes the features and functionality that the product requires to meet the needs of the stakeholders. A standard SRS should include items such as a goal, a summary, and a specific requirement. Correctness, unambiguity, completeness, consistency, verifiability, modifiability, and traceability are all features of a good SRS document. An SRS document includes functional requirements that specify what action a system must take. It also includes a non-functional requirement that defines a software system's performance.
